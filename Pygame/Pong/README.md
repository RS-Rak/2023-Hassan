This is where my pong files are.

Paddle.py - Contains the paddle class, which controls the 2 paddles

Menus.py - Contains the important write function, which is used to write text everywhere. 

Main.py - Contains the majority of the code - the main game loop, all of the constants and variables. 

FONTS - This folder contains the fonts which I'm using.

SOUNDS - Contains the music and noises, which are used when the ball bounces or the main background music
